		//   _would_ be prevented... And then, this state would either need to be serialized, or I'd need to guarantee

			// i'm thinking Creature or CreatureBase or CreatureDefinition should have a static Create method that takes care of a few things....
			//   It would hide the ctor, mostly because there might be a few subclasses of Creature, and the only thing that should care about THAT is serialization.
			//   It MIGHT provide a few bool options for the classic stuff like 'schedule an event for this' or 'add this to the map'. Maybe, maybe not.
